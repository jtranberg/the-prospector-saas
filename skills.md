# Project Summary

The Prospector is an AI-assisted hockey intelligence platform designed to aggregate, normalize, enrich, and visualize global player data for scouts, coaches, and hockey operations staff.

The application combines a continually growing MongoDB prospect database with Elite Prospects data enrichment to provide fast player discovery, statistical analysis, scouting insights, and interactive dashboards.

The platform is designed with scalability in mind and supports hundreds of thousands of player records.
