# Design Principles

The architecture follows several guiding principles.

## Separation of Concerns

Each layer focuses on a specific responsibility.

## Modular Development

Features are organized into reusable components to simplify maintenance and future development.

## Scalability

The architecture is designed to support additional datasets, organizational workspaces, AI services, and analytics without major restructuring.

## Performance

Search, filtering, enrichment, and visualization are optimized to support large prospect datasets while maintaining a responsive user experience.

## Maintainability

Shared layouts, reusable components, and clear separation between frontend and backend reduce technical debt and improve long-term sustainability.

# Future Architecture

Planned architectural enhancements include:

* Organization accounts
* Multi-user workspaces
* Scout collaboration
* Digital player card publishing
* AI-generated scouting reports
* Real-time synchronization
* Mobile application support
* Expanded analytics engine
* Additional licensed data integrations
