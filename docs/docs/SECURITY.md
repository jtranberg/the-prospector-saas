# Security

Security is a foundational design principle of TheProspector.

The platform is developed with the objective of protecting user information, scouting intelligence, application integrity, and operational reliability through practical engineering and responsible software development.

Security is treated as a continuous process rather than a single feature.

---

# Security Objectives

The platform is designed to:

* Protect user accounts
* Protect scouting information
* Maintain platform integrity
* Secure communications
* Support responsible access to data
* Minimize operational risk

---

# Security Principles

## Defense in Depth

Multiple layers of protection are used throughout the application rather than relying on a single security mechanism.

These layers include application security, infrastructure security, database protections, and operational controls.

---

## Least Privilege

Access should be limited to only the information and functionality required for a user's responsibilities.

Future organization workspaces will expand role-based permissions for scouts, coaches, administrators, and team staff.

---

## Secure by Default

New platform features are designed with security considerations from the beginning rather than added later.

Security reviews are incorporated into the development process whenever practical.

---

# Platform Security

## Secure Communications

The platform is intended to operate using encrypted HTTPS connections to protect data transmitted between users and platform services.

---

## Authentication

Protected platform features should only be available to authenticated users.

Authentication systems are designed to support secure session management and account protection.

---

## Authorization

Platform access is controlled according to user permissions.

Future releases will expand role-based access for multi-organization deployments.

---

## Database Security

Player information, scouting data, and platform records are stored using managed MongoDB infrastructure with provider-level security features.

Operational safeguards include:

* Authentication
* Access controls
* Managed backups
* Secure connectivity

---

## API Security

The Express API is designed with:

* Input validation
* Error handling
* Route organization
* Controlled access
* Performance monitoring

Future releases may introduce:

* API authentication
* Rate limiting
* Audit logging
* Organization-level API access

---

# Data Protection

The platform is developed with the goal of protecting:

* User accounts
* Scouting notes
* Saved searches
* Watch lists
* Platform configuration
* Operational metadata

Private organizational information should remain isolated from other organizations.

---

# Operational Security

Operational practices include:

* Version control
* Documentation
* Continuous improvement
* Dependency updates
* Platform monitoring
* Responsible deployment practices

---

# Responsible Disclosure

If a security issue is discovered, App Intelligence encourages responsible disclosure.

Reports should include:

* Description of the issue
* Steps to reproduce
* Potential impact
* Suggested mitigation (if known)

Security reports will be reviewed and prioritized according to potential platform impact.

---

# Future Security Enhancements

Planned improvements include:

* Multi-factor authentication
* Audit logging
* Organization administration
* Enhanced permission management
* Session monitoring
* Security dashboards
* Automated security testing
* Expanded monitoring

---

# Security Philosophy

Effective security supports productivity without creating unnecessary complexity.

TheProspector is developed with the objective of providing a secure, maintainable, and trustworthy platform for modern hockey intelligence while continuing to improve through ongoing engineering and operational refinement.
